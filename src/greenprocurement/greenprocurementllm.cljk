(ns greenprocurement.greenprocurementllm
  "GreenProcurement-LLM client -- the *contained intelligence node* for
  the JPN-MOE (Ministry of the Environment) compliance actor.

  It normalizes engagement intake, drafts a per-track
  (`:green-purchasing` / `:eco-conscious-contracts`) compliance
  evidence checklist, drafts the filing-draft action, and drafts the
  filing-submit action. CRITICAL: it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor.
  It returns a *proposal* (with a rationale + the fields it cited),
  never a committed record or a real MOE filing. Every output is
  censored downstream by `greenprocurement.governor` before anything
  touches the SSoT, and `:filing/draft`/`:filing/submit` proposals
  NEVER auto-commit at any phase -- see README Actuation. This actor
  stays strictly at the compliance-PROCESS level -- it never reasons
  about environmental-engineering standards, only paperwork /
  conformity-confirmation / documentation-status facts.

  Like every sibling actor's advisor, this is a deterministic mock so
  the actor graph runs offline and the governor contract is exercised
  end-to-end."
